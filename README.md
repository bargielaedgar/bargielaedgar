# Edgar Bargiela 
**M.Sc. Statistical Techniques | Mathematician**

I turn raw data into actionable insights using advanced Mathematics and Operational Discipline.

###  Professional Profile
With a **Master's in Statistical Techniques (University of Vigo)** and 14 years of experience in Operational Intelligence (Brazilian Navy), I bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world execution.

###  Expertise
* **Predictive Modeling:** Building models to estimate outcomes (Monte Carlo / Bayesian).
* **Data Engineering:** Automating pipelines with Python and SQL.
* **Operational Intelligence:** Translating data for decision-making.

### Portfolio: From Theory to Practice

Below are selected projects that demonstrate my range across different domains:

#### 1. Applied Sports Analytics 
* **Project:** [Football Scouting Dashboard (La Liga 25/26)](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/football-scouting-dashboard)
* **Goal:** Create an interactive tool for scouts to identify hidden talents using efficiency metrics (G+A per 90min).
* **Methodology:** Developed a full-stack **Shiny App** with real-time linear regression models and Head-to-Head comparison.
* **[CLICK HERE TO VIEW LIVE APP](https://w99itd-edgar-garcia.shinyapps.io/Football-scouting-dashboard-laliga2526-Edgar/)**

#### 2. Statistical Simulation
* **Project:** [Monte Carlo Sensitivity Benchmark](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/anomaly_detection_simulation.R)
* **Goal:** Determine critical guidelines for risk management: which statistical test is reliable when data is scarce?
* **Methodology:** Designed a Monte Carlo simulation engine (2,000 iterations) to compare the Power of normality tests under two scenarios: Scarcity ($n=15$) and Abundance ($n=50$)..

#### 3. Process Automation 
* **Project:** [Automated Data Diagnostic](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/automated-data-diagnostic)
* **Goal:** Eliminate human error in statistical model selection.
* **Methodology:** Built an algorithmic decision tree that audits data distribution assumptions and automatically selects the appropriate inference method (Parametric vs. Robust/Non-Parametric).

#### 4. Market Research
* **Project:** [Consumer Preference Analysis](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/market-research-coffee-analysis)
* **Goal:** Validate marketing claims scientifically, eliminating evaluator bias.
* **Methodology:** Applied **Friedman** and **Nemenyi** non-parametric tests in a block-design experiment to rank brand preference statistically.
