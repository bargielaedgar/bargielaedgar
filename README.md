### Hi there! I'm Edgar Bargiela.

**M.Sc. Student in Statistical Techniques (University of Vigo) | Data Scientist**

I am a professional transitioning into Data Science with a unique background: I bring the discipline and leadership of **15 years as a Sergeant in the Brazilian Navy**, combined with a rigorous academic foundation in **Mathematics** and **Statistics**.

Currently based in **Spain**, I focus on transforming complex data into business decisions using statistical modeling, simulation, and interactive visualization.
