### Edgar Bargiela

**M.Sc. Candidate in Statistical Techniques (University of Vigo) | Mathematician**

I bridge the gap between **Mathematical Rigor** and **Operational Excellence**.

My professional DNA is built on two strong pillars:
1.  **Theoretical Depth:** A **B.Sc. in Mathematics** and an ongoing Master's in Statistics, giving me the ability to understand *why* models work, not just how to run them.
2.  **Leadership & Discipline:** **15 years as a Sergeant in the Brazilian Navy**, where I honed my skills in team management, logistics, and high-stakes decision-making.

Currently, I apply this unique blend of discipline and analytical thinking to **Data Science**.

### Portfolio: From Theory to Practice

I specialize in **R**, **Stochastic Simulation**, and **Interactive Dashboards**. Below are 4 selected projects that demonstrate my range:

#### 1. Applied Sports Analytics (The "Visual" Project)
* **Project:** [Football Scouting Dashboard (La Liga 25/26)](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/football-scouting-dashboard)
* **Goal:** Create a tool for scouts to identify hidden talents using efficiency metrics.
* **Methodology:** Developed a full-stack **Shiny App** with real-time linear regression and H2H comparison.
* **[View Live App](https://w99itd-edgar-garcia.shinyapps.io/Football-scouting-dashboard-laliga2526-Edgar/)**

#### 2. Statistical Simulation (The "Hard Stat" Project) 
* **Project:** [Monte Carlo Sensitivity Benchmark](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/algorithm-sensitivity-benchmark)
* **Goal:** Determine which statistical test is reliable when data is scarce.
* **Methodology:** Designed a **Monte Carlo simulation** (2,000 iterations) to audit the Power of normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk vs. Lilliefors) under small sample sizes ($n=15$).

#### 3. Process Automation (The "Pipeline" Project) 
* **Project:** [Automated Data Diagnostic](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/automated-data-diagnostic)
* **Goal:** Eliminate human error in model selection.
* **Methodology:** Built an algorithmic decision tree that audits data distribution and automatically selects the appropriate inference method (Parametric vs. Robust).

#### 4. Market Research (The "Business" Project) 
* **Project:** [Consumer Preference Analysis](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/consumer-preference-analysis)
* **Goal:** Validate marketing claims scientifically.
* **Methodology:** Applied **Friedman** and **Nemenyi** non-parametric tests to analyze experimental data and rank brand preference without bias.
