### I'm Edgar Bargiela 👋

**M.Sc. Candidate in Statistical Techniques (University of Vigo) | Mathematician | Data Scientist**

I bridge the gap between **Mathematical Rigor** and **Operational Excellence**.

My professional DNA is built on two strong pillars:
1.  **Theoretical Depth:** A **B.Sc. in Mathematics** and an ongoing Master's in Statistics, giving me the ability to understand *why* models work, not just how to run them.
2.  **Leadership & Discipline:** **14 years as a Sergeant in the Brazilian Navy**, where I honed my skills in team management, logistics, and high-stakes decision-making under pressure.

Currently based in **Spain**, I apply this unique blend of discipline and analytical thinking to solve complex data problems.

### Portfolio: From Theory to Practice

Below are selected projects that demonstrate my range across different domains:

#### 1. Applied Sports Analytics (The "Visual" Project)
* **Project:** [Football Scouting Dashboard (La Liga 25/26)](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/football-scouting-dashboard)
* **Goal:** Create an interactive tool for scouts to identify hidden talents using efficiency metrics (G+A per 90min).
* **Methodology:** Developed a full-stack **Shiny App** with real-time linear regression models and Head-to-Head comparison.
* **[CLICK HERE TO VIEW LIVE APP](https://w99itd-edgar-garcia.shinyapps.io/Football-scouting-dashboard-laliga2526-Edgar/)**

#### 2. Statistical Simulation (The "Hard Stat" Project)
* **Project:** [Monte Carlo Sensitivity Benchmark](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/algorithm-sensitivity-benchmark)
* **Goal:** Determine critical guidelines for risk management: which statistical test is reliable when data is scarce?
* **Methodology:** Designed a **Monte Carlo simulation engine** (2,000 iterations) to audit the Power of normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk vs. Lilliefors) under small sample sizes ($n=15$).

#### 3. Process Automation (The "Pipeline" Project)
* **Project:** [Automated Data Diagnostic](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/automated-data-diagnostic)
* **Goal:** Eliminate human error in statistical model selection.
* **Methodology:** Built an algorithmic decision tree that audits data distribution assumptions and automatically selects the appropriate inference method (Parametric vs. Robust/Non-Parametric).

#### 4. Market Research (The "Business" Project)
* **Project:** [Consumer Preference Analysis](https://github.com/bargielaedgar/consumer-preference-analysis)
* **Goal:** Validate marketing claims scientifically, eliminating evaluator bias.
* **Methodology:** Applied **Friedman** and **Nemenyi** non-parametric tests in a block-design experiment to rank brand preference statistically.
